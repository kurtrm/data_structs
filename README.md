#More Data Structures for Python 401


## Binary Search Tree
Implement a binary search tree with insert(), search()
size(), depth(), contains(), and balance() methods.

## BST Traversals

Implement the following traversals:

- In-order
- Pre-order
- Post-order
- Breadth-first

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal
Each returns a generator that will yield nodes according to their conventions.

## Hash Table

Implemented a hash table that has the option to use either a complex or naive hash.

## Sorting Algorithms

Implemented the following sorting algorithms:

+ Bubble Sort - O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted
+ Insertion Sort - O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted
+ Mergesort - O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of elements to be sorted
+ Quicksort - O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of elements to be sorted
+ Radix Sort - O(n * k), where k is the number of digits in the largest number to be sorted

# Tries

Contains an implementation of a trie, along with traversals and an autocomplete method.

+ Traversal - O(n), where n is the number of letters in the sub-trie branching from the input string
+ Autocomplete - O(n), where n is the number of letters in the sub-trie branching from the input string
